# Shape Game

This is a Java-based game where players collect and stack randomly generated geometric shapes (squares, triangles, pentagons, and circles) to maximize 
their score. Players decide whether to keep or discard each new shape, earning points based on its area and potential bonuses. 

Matching shapes or equal-area shapes  trigger special scoring mechanics. The game ends when the player's stack reaches its limit or all shapes have been generated. The goal is to achieve the highest possible score.
